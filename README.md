StellarFeed 🌌

StellarFeed is a dynamic web application that serves as your daily hub for diverse cosmic content. Built to be interactive and visually appealing, it integrates with external APIs to provide real-time information on astronomy news, celestial photography, and original poetry.

Key Features 🚀
Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD): A homepage that fetches and displays a new image from NASA's official APOD API on every visit.

Real-Time News: A dedicated "News" page with a real-time search bar that allows users to find recent articles on space and astronomy. The data is fetched from the NewsAPI.org.

Generative Poetry: A "Poems" page that dynamically generates unique, space-themed poetry using the Google Gemini API, alongside a collection of classic space-related quotes.

Responsive and Polished UI/UX: The entire website is designed with a sleek, dark theme and is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

API Integrations 🔌
StellarFeed relies on the following third-party APIs to deliver its dynamic content:

NASA APOD API: For the daily astronomy picture.

NewsAPI.org: For fetching the latest news headlines related to space.

Google Gemini API: For generating creative and unique poetry.


This project meets the requirements for a second-year student by integrating multiple third-party APIs, providing a dynamic user experience, and using a modern, component-based structure.
